Situation
===
(CSAT?) FOB has been established near Rasman, bolstering their presence and allowing them to continue operations in the area with fewer supply issues.
Takistani supply routes are progressively being cut off by the strengthened (CSAT?) presence.
The Takistani armed forces want that FOB gone and have sent in a convoy to cripple it.
Wiping out the FOB should cause significant chaos for (CSAT?) groups operating within it's influence, allowing Takistani forces to move in and re-establish supply with the North. 

The convoy has faced troubles on its route; multiple vehicle failures and small ambushes thinning them out slowly.
Only a portion of the original convoy remain and, while within firing range, needs a safe place to set up and rearm first.
The Takistanis have begun contacting various militia along the route to assist in escorting the remainder of the convoy.

This is where you come in.
Your group is located along the last leg of the route between Feruz Abad and Garmsar.
The convoy will be passing through soon and will be stopping at a nearby FARP just east of Rasman where it will rearm and assault the FOB.
